This repository contains the pretrained models, 2 synthetic PET-EEG datasets, and demo of GLEAM.

GLEAM is a biologically grounded deep learning system for seizure prediction,
integrating neuroinflammatory biomarkers with EEG dynamics. It introduces:
a PET-informed glial-neuronal manifold via supervised contrastive learning,
retaining 94.3% of pathological features; a PET-regularized LSTM-GRU model
achieving 92.1% AUC; and an interpretability suite attributing seizure risk to
astrocytic (δ = 0.12 ± 0.03) and microglial (δ = 0.09 ± 0.02) states, reducing
false positives by 67% (p = 0.008). GLEAM anticipates seizures ≥20 minutes
ahead in 82% of cases (F1 = 0.89) with 5 ms latency, enabled by a spectral
attention filter (SNR ↑63%) and a contrastive glial-neuronal boundary robust
to perturbations. As an open-source, closed-loop prototype, GLEAM redefines
seizure prediction as a biologically interpretable, real-time, and clinically viable
task.
